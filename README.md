# Healthlete
This is my final year project, Healthlete.

It strives to give users' greater control over their physical health goals. It primarily focuses on fitness and diet.

Healthlete allows users to log in and save a range of detailed, empowering information in the following features:

It has functionality for food logging and calculating the calories, carbs and protein in entries made along with displaying it in both table and a more visual pie chart format displaying both the sum of these amounts along with the percentage users have reached for their daily target. Such targets are also customisable based on their dynamic body status and goals.

Healthlete also has exercise logging functionality enabling users to add their favourite exercises and track their progress in that particular exercise and also view all of their workouts performed on a selected date. It can also calculate a user's strength level in their desired exercise and provide them with a range of upcoming targets slightly more difficult than their previous entry along a plethora of rep ranges.

It has achievement logging whereby users can set themselves detailed goals with measures like difficulty and expected time frame to complete and they can also view their completed goals encouraging them to remember their success and to perhaps build upon it with more difficult challenges.

Users can also add a workout area selecting it manually on a map close to their current location or via search bar also directing them towards it on the map. Healthlete then collects the opening and closing times of the selected area and enables users to select days which they'll receive timed reminders that their workout area/gym is closing in the next two hours if they want to proceed with their original plan of working out.

It tries to abide by the principles of universal design and also provides a Healthlete Guide & Walkthrough which is linked below:
